# 4. Merge final-project-001 and final-project-API repositories

Date: 15.09.2019

## Status

Accepted



## Context
When the project was initially developing two repositories were created:
final-project-001, and final-project-API.

This is not intuitive to managing a single application and will result in an overhead if both applications are deployed seperately.

## Decision
This decision is to combine both the above two repos into a single repository:
final-project-combined

## Consequences

Only use the single repository moving forward and delete the previous repositories
